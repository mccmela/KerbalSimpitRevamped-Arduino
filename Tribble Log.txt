Coding

- Momentary Buttons: need to be coded into a toggle function rather than a switch that needs to be depressed. Right now, it only activates/deactviates when held in the down position. 
- Button D6 does not work. 



Design

- Red guard switch is in the way of the joysticks, cannot get full deflection. 


Wants

- Add map button
- Add LCD "time to maneuver"
